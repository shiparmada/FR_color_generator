Hi there! You're using my color generator app. This is version 1.4.0 so it's a little clunky, but it works!

The file is in the dist folder, all you have to do is double click the file and follow the prompts.

It's important to note that turtles, which is the thing that runs the image generator, closes when you click on the body of the window after it's done running (you'll know it's done running when the cursor disappears). I recommend screenshotting it before clicking on the body of the window. This is one of the things I hope to fix in a future update.

As of version 1.2.0, you no longer have to put in the color names with all lower cases, and even typos will no longer cause the program to crash!

Also important to note: One of the new questions added is "What is the maximum number of colors before needing to shrink?". This is to help the Turtles from running off the screen. I recommend starting with "80", and then if they continue to scurry off the screen, try decreasing the number.

Have fun!
