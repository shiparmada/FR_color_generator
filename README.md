Hi there! You're using my color generator app. This is version 1.1.0 so it's a little clunky, but it works!

The file is in the dist file, all you have to do is double click the file and follow the prompts.

It's important to note that turtles, which is the thing that runs the image generator, closes when you click on the body of the window after it's done running (you'll know it's done running when the cursor dashes away off the screen). I recommend screenshotting it before clicking on the body of the window. This is one of the things I hope to fix in a future update.

Also important to note: the prompts will only accept color names that are in all lowercase with no spaces and must be spelled correctly. Another thing I'm going to try to fix in future updates.

Also also important to note: One of the new questions added is "What is the maximum number of colors before needing to shrink?". This is to help the Turtles from running off the screen. I recommend starting with "80", and then if they continue to scurry off the screen, try decreasing the number.

Have fun!
