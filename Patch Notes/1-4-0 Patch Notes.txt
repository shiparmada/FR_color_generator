Patch Notes

- New Features!

4 new shapes have been added! Pentagons, overlapping pentagons, single line 6 sides, single line 3 sides.
 Note: The single lines work best for dragon pairings that have really wide color bands

- Adjusted the turtle!

The turtle no longer runs away when it's done but just disappears in a poof of smoke
 Note: Smoke not included
